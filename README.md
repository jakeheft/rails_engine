# README

## What's this app?!


## Learning Goals
 - Exposing an API
 - Use serializers to format JSON responses
 - Test API exposure
 - Compose advanced ActiveRecord queries to analyze information stored in SQL databases

## Setup
1. Create a directory (e.g. rails_engine) as a parent directory
1. `cd` into that directory and run the following commands:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rails_driver.git
   ```
   - This will clone the [front end repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rails_driver.git) of this project that contains a test suite
   ```
   rails new rails_engine -T -d postgresql --api
   ```
   - This will create a Rails API app using PostgreSQL
   **Both of these directories should live inside the parent directory you made**
1.
