# README

## What's this app?!


## Learning Goals
- Exposing an API
- Use serializers to format JSON responses
- Test API exposure
- Compose advanced ActiveRecord queries to analyze information stored in SQL databases

## Versions
- Ruby 2.5.3
- Rails 5.2.4.4

## Setup
1. Create a directory (e.g. rails_engine) as a parent directory
1. `cd` into that directory and run the following commands:

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/rails_driver.git
   ```
   - This will clone the [front end repo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rails_driver.git) of this project that contains a test suite  

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:jakeheft/rails_engine.git
   ```
   - This will clone the [back end repo](https://github.com/jakeheft/rails_engine) of this project  

   **_Both of these directories should live inside the parent directory you made_**
1. `cd` into rails_engine (child directory) and run `bundle install` and then ` rails g rspec:install`
